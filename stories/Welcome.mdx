# Storybook Twig Bridge Demo
👋 Welcome to the demo.  This project showcases a more direct integration of
Twig into Storybook.

## How does it work?
A light-weight Symfony application is installed in a Service Worker and runs
within a PHP 8.4 web assembly runtime 🤓. A simple controller takes a pattern
ID and query parameters from Storybook requests and passes them through to the
appropriate twig template for rendering.

Unlike alternatives in this space, this
demo uses the official bleeding edge of Twig and is guaranteed to stay up to
date with the main product.
